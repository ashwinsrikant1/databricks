    "# Summary and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated advanced Unity Catalog operations across four key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔐 Permissions Management\n",
    "- **Hierarchical permissions**: Catalog → Schema → Object level\n",
    "- **Role-based access control**: Define permissions by user roles\n",
    "- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 👥 Identity & Access Management\n",
    "- **Comprehensive auditing**: Track who has access to what\n",
    "- **Group management**: Use groups for scalable permission management\n",
    "- **Regular access reviews**: Monitor and audit permissions regularly\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Data Lineage\n",
    "- **Automatic tracking**: Unity Catalog tracks most lineage automatically\n",
    "- **Custom lineage**: Add BYOL for external processes\n",
    "- **Impact analysis**: Understand downstream effects of changes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 Metric Views\n",
    "- **Consistent definitions**: Centralize business metric definitions\n",
    "- **Multi-dimensional analysis**: Support various business dimensions\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Always document metric calculations and business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement governance policies** using the permission patterns shown\n",
    "2. **Set up regular access audits** using the identity management queries\n",
    "3. **Create lineage documentation** for all critical data flows\n",
    "4. **Build a metric catalog** using the framework patterns demonstrated\n",
    "5. **Automate monitoring** of permissions, lineage, and metric quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to adapt these patterns to your specific organizational needs and compliance requirements!"
