    "# MCP Genie Tool-Calling Agent with Databricks Claude Sonnet 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a powerful tool-calling agent using Databricks' Claude Sonnet 4 endpoint with the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Genie server. The agent can query structured data tables through Genie spaces and perform complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP Genie server allows you to:\n",
    "- Query Genie spaces to get insights from structured data tables\n",
    "- Access structured data through natural language queries\n",
    "- Integrate data insights into conversational AI workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Databricks workspace with access to **Claude Sonnet 4 endpoint**\n",
    "- MCP Genie server access (Beta)\n",
    "- **OAuth authentication** (Service Principal with OAuth credentials)\n",
    "- Python 3.12 or above\n",
    "- Required Python packages (see installation section below)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **⚠️ Important**: This notebook uses OAuth authentication exclusively and is configured for **Claude Sonnet 4** by default. You must set up a Service Principal with OAuth credentials to use this agent."
