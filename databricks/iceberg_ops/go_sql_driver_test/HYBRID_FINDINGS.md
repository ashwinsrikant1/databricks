# Hybrid Approach: Go Driver + REST API Timing

## Summary

**YES** - It is possible to supplement the Go Driver with REST API calls to get comprehensive timing information.

## Key Findings

### 1. Different Query Identifiers
- **Go Driver Query ID**: `01f07d87-5224-1a4f-9b71-4df311d1506e`
- **REST API Statement ID**: `01f07d87-5275-1bbe-adb1-5c69bf8ca25d`

The Go driver uses internal Spark query IDs, while the REST API uses Statement Execution API identifiers. These are different systems.

### 2. Timing Comparison
- **Go Driver**: 553ms (external timing measurement)
- **REST API**: 660ms (includes network overhead + execution)
- **Difference**: ~107ms

Both execute the same query but through different pathways.

### 3. Hybrid Approach Viability

✅ **What Works:**
- Execute queries via Go Driver for normal operation
- Use REST API in parallel to get timing metadata
- Compare results for consistency
- Get comprehensive timing information not available in Go driver

❌ **Limitations:**
- Cannot directly correlate Go driver query ID with REST API statement ID
- Requires two separate executions (Go driver + REST API)
- REST API adds network overhead
- Query history lookup may have delays

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Parallel Execution
```go
// Execute same query via both methods
goResult := executeViaGoDriver(query)
restTiming := executeViaRESTAPI(query)

// Combine results
result := CombinedResult{
    Data: goResult.Data,           // Use Go driver for data
    Timing: restTiming.Timing,     // Use REST API for timing
}
```

### Option 2: Go Driver + Query History Lookup
```go
// Execute via Go driver
result := executeViaGoDriver(query)

// Look up timing in system.query.history (with delay)
time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
timing := queryHistoryLookup(query, startTime)
```

### Option 3: REST API Only
```go
// Use REST API for everything
result := executeViaRESTAPI(query)
// Gets both data and timing metadata
```

## Recommendation

For **production use cases** requiring timing data:

1. **Use Go Driver for primary execution** (better integration, connection pooling)
2. **Supplement with periodic REST API calls** for timing analysis
3. **Use query history** for historical timing analysis
4. **Consider REST API only** for timing-critical applications

## Test Results

The hybrid approach successfully demonstrates:
- Both methods return identical results (1 row, 2 columns)
- REST API provides comprehensive timing metadata
- Go driver provides faster execution with external timing
- Network overhead accounts for timing differences

This proves that **timing information IS available** from Databricks, but the Go driver simply doesn't expose it to users.
